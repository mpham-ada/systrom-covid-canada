# systrom-covid-canada

Adapted Kevin Systrom's covid-19 jupyter notebook to calculate for R(t) (https://github.com/k-sys/covid-19/blob/master/Realtime%20R0.ipynb) for Canadian provinces.

Canadian covid-19 data originally from here: https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada
I cleaned the dataset above into the canada-covid3.csv file to fix the datetime format to be consistent with Systrom's code
